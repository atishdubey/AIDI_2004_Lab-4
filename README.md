Fish Prediction Logistic regression

# Problem Statement
Predicting the species of fish by dimensions and weight.

# Logistics Regression
Calculated relapse is a measurable model that, at its most basic level, uses a strategic capacity to illustrate a paired ward variable, however there are many more complex augmentations. Calculated relapse (or logit relapse) is a relapse testing technique that assesses the bounds of a strategy model (a type of double relapse).

# Data Description
This dataset contains information on seven common and diverse fish species that were purchased at a fish market. With this dataset, a predictive model based on machine cordial data may be created to predict fish heaviness.

# Conclusion 
Despite the fact that we only had a limited dataset, our model performed admirably, with a Training set score of 0.973 and a Test set score of 0.938.
However, I feel compelled to provide a brief but significant comment concerning the performance of a model and dataset. Let's take a look at probability theory to better appreciate how good performance can be deceived.
If the number of species in our sample were evenly distributed, the likelihood of correctly guessing one would be 1/7. We, on the other hand, have a variety of species values, with a total of 159 species. So the chance of guessing 'Perch' is 56/159, and the chances of guessing other species are 35/159, 20/159, 17/159, 14/159, 11/159, and 6/159. In order to get a precise demonstration of a small number of species by Logistic Regression.Furthermore, having various distinguishing characteristics, such as weight, length, and so on, increases the likelihood of finding the correct kind. Having a bigger number of species is one method to demonstrate high potential.
